## Start 
- Spring initializr : https://start.spring.io/
- Utilized: Java/Spring, MySQL, Redis, RDS, EC2, ElastiCache
- Monitoring : Aws CloudWatch, Promethous, Grafana


## MySQL
- Developed coupon issuing function using MySQL

## Redis
- I handled traffic bottlenecks in MySQL by redirecting the overloaded traffic to Redis for efficient processing.
- I resolved concurrency issues in simultaneous coupon issuance requests by implementing distributed locking, ensuring that critical sections were accessed sequentially to prevent conflicts.
